# Electrocardiogram

An electrocardiogram is a medical tool that records the electrical activity of the heart.

## Getting Started

This was my final project for the Microprocessors I course from UAGM (ELEN 442). The main objective of this project is to measure heart readings using Arduino and electrodes. These readings should be displayed on a LCD/LED/OLED screen (i.e., showing the Normal Sinus Rhythm waveform). 

### Electronics Components

- Arduino Uno R3
- Sparkfun’s AD8232 Sensor
- KMR 1.8 SPI (Or any other LCD TFT Screen)
- ECG Electrodes
- Cardiac Simulator (Optional)
- Light Emitting Diodes
- Jumper Cables
- Breadboard
- Buzzer
- USB Cable Type B

### Building Procedure

A step by step series will be updated later.
